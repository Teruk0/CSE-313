Group313 from CSE 120 project 

Getting Setup;
1. In a different code, or the command prompt open the coding terminal and type in:
npm i express

npm i nodemon -D

npm install react-scripts

(nodemon lets you edit the server while updating automatically)

2. Open the folder with the files and in order to open the backend type into the coding terminal:

cd server 

npm run dev

you'll be able to find the page in localhost:5000/api

3. if you want to open the frontend instead, you open a new terminal and can just do
cd client type npm start 

and it will open it in:
localhost:3000
